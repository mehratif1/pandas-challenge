The code analyzes the district-wide standardised test results of the schools. 
By looking at the reading and maths scores as well as various other information on the schools being provided  like the school budget, size and the type of school as well as the budget per student , obvious trends in the school performance have been identified by applying certain calculations like finding the average passing rate in schools.
In the first step a Data Frame has been created District-wise and then in the second step similar Data Frame has been made that summarizes key metrics about the schools individually.
Data Frames are created for Highest-Performaing and Lowest-Performing Schools by %Overall Passing rate.
More Data Frames are created for "Maths Scores by Grade", "Reading Scores by Grade" , "Scores by School Spending","Scores by School Size" and "Scores by School Type"respectively.

# TWO CONCLUSIONS/COMPARISONS BASED ON THE CALCULATIONS:

It is observed after doing the calculations that the schools that are smaller in size meaning the schools with less number of students (<2000) have higher overall passing rate as compared to the bigger size schools with the Total number of students >2000 , so the school size should be kept small for better results.

Among the two school types Charter and District , the Charter schools have much higher Overall Passing rate 90.4% as compared to the District type schools with a percentage of 53.67%.
